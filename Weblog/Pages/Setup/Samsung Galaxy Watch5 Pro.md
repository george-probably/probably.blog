## Samsung Galaxy Watch5 Pro

I tried to be patient with the Ticwatch Pro 3, I really did. I said in my setup page about it that the watch itself was alright, but it was being hamstrung by terrible software support. Unfortunately, it got to the point where I felt fed up, so I ended up backsliding to my old ex Samsung to take a look at their shiny new toy.

The Galaxy Watch5 Pro is EXPENSIVE. There are a few reason for that, including the titanium and saphire construction, and also the inclusion of a body temperature sensor, I didn't get it brand-new however.

I happen to accrue quite a lot of tech, so every now and again I'll go down to my local CeX, drop it all off, and use the voucher to buy a piece of tech I actually want. Sure, it's not the most money I could get for my stuff, but it *does* safe all of the faff.

In my case, I paid exactly £3 of actual cash for my watch. A bargain for a £499 watch, especially when it was marked as coming without a strap (they included it), and as the bluetooth-only model (it actually has 4G).

The battery life is genuinely great. Lasting 72 hours without issue, and completely eliminiating my fear of needing to take a charger with me if I go away for a weekend. Better still - you can actually just use a Qi charger, so you don't need a proprietary cable!

Less perfect though is the feature-set. The truth is that some features require a Samsung phone. Most don't matter to me, such a blood pressure tracking, but the one that doesn't make sense to me is 4G. 

To activate 4G on a Galaxy Watch5 Pro you NEED to use a Samsung phone. Sure, in theory you can borrow a mate's, link your number, then reset it and pair it back to yours (eSIMs survive a factory reset), but that's not the point.

Those little niggles are what stops me from really LOVING this watch. Would I have ever used the 4G? Probably not. It would have been nice to have as an option though.
