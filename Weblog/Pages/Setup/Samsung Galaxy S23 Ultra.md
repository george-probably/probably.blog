## Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra

I tried to be patient with the Ticwatch Pro 3; I really did. I said on my setup page that the watch was alright, but it was being hamstrung by terrible software support. Unfortunately, it got to the point where I felt fed up, so I ended up backsliding to my old ex-Samsung to take a look at their shiny new toy.

The Galaxy Watch5 Pro is EXPENSIVE. There are a few reasons for that, including the titanium and sapphire construction and the inclusion of a body temperature sensor; I didn't get it brand-new, however.

I accrue quite a lot of tech, so every now and again, I'll go down to my local CeX, drop it all off, and use the voucher to buy a piece of tech I want. Sure, it's not the most money I could get for my stuff, but it does save all of the faff.

In my case, I paid precisely £3 of actual cash for my watch. A bargain for a £499 watch, especially when it was marked as coming without a strap (they included it) and as the Bluetooth-only model (it actually has 4G).

The battery life is genuinely superb. Lasting 72 hours without issue and eliminating my fear of needing to take a charger with me if I go away for a weekend. Better still - you can use a Qi charger, so you don't need a proprietary cable!

Less perfect, though, is the feature set. The truth is that some features require a Samsung phone, and most don't matter to me, such as blood pressure tracking, but the one that doesn't make sense to me is 4G.

You NEED a Samsung phone to activate 4G on a Galaxy Watch5 Pro. Sure, in theory, you can borrow a mate's, link your number, then reset it and pair it back to yours (eSIMs survive a factory reset), but that's not the point.

Those little niggles are what stops me from really LOVING this watch. Would I have ever used the 4G? Probably not. It would have been nice to have it as an option, though!
