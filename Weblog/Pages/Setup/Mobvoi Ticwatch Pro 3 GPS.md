## Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro 3 GPS

You may have noticed: this is the lowest-rated product on my entire list of gear. The first thing that multiple people have asked me was, "George, why are you using a watch that you hate?" and honestly, that's a fair question.

The truth is, the low rating doesn't actually come from the hardware itself. Sure, I replaced my Galaxy Watch4 Classic, and part of the reason was that I was exchanging some of the smarts of the Galaxy Watch4 for better battery life, but the reality is that it isn't better *enough*.

More importantly, though, the rating is so low because of the software support that Mobvoi has (or, in this case, hasn't) provided. Mobvoi promised an update to WearOS 3 all the way back in 2021! It was promised to come before the end of 2022 and.. it hasn't. More frustratingly though, there has been radio silence from Mobvoi as to when we can expect this update to release.

Personally, I'd be content with a "Hey guys, we're sorry, this is actually taking way longer than we expected and will need to push it back a couple of months", but instead, the company line is: "We are sorry that we do not have the information about when watch will get the Wear OS 3 update at the moment. Please stay tuned to our official website mobvoi.com and subscribe to our newsletter for further announcements. Thanks for your patience and understanding."

This complete lack of transparency is a way bigger issue than the software itself, which is an issue because the hardware is super interesting. The watch has two screens AND two processors; there's an ultra-low-power screen which can power the watch for up to 45 days and a dedicated processor to power it.

Movboi recently released a new sleep-tracking subscription to rub salt into the wound, putting some information freely available behind a paywall. They also recently released their marketplace for watch faces, and my only question is: why?? 

So that's my little rant over. The Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro 3 is a reasonably nice piece of hardware, but it is being held back by a company that prioritises the wrong things.

### Verdict: 6/10
