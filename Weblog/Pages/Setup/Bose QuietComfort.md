## Bose QuietComfort (2023)

The Bose QuietComfort are my go-to headphones when it comes to either long-term listening, or listening on-the-go. The noise cancelling is incredible, and the headphones themselves are super comfortable for extended wearing.

I use them wirelessly with my phone / laptops, but also plugged in to my Mac Studio whenever I'm doing any work. They are the perfect over-ear companion. That being said, they are no longer the highest end option Bose offers. There are the [Bose QuietComfort Ultra](https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/bose-quietcomfort-headphones-ultra.html), but the actual benefits seem to be a bit beyond me.

The main reason I upgraded from my QC35 II was the existence of a USB-C port, meaning Micro-USB had finally been purged from my life. If you want something that looks a little cooler, then go for the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. Finally, if you want something that isn't Bose at all, I recommend the Sony WH-1000XM5. My headphone hot-take is that all of the options in this price range are SUPER competitive, and the one you should get is the one currently on the deepest discount.

### Verdict: 9/10
