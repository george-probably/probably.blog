## Ray-Ban Stories

As a purchase, the Ray-Ban Stories were something of a no-brainer for me. I have been using Snap's Spectacles since the 1st generation, being one of the very first to get one in the UK from the pop-up vending machines they had before you could just buy them online.

Though the video quality wasn't great, and battery life was shocking, I saw the vision. Skiing, driving, going to a concert - if it was a situation where you didn't want to be holding up a phone, the Spectacles were perfect.

The Ray-Ban stories are all of that and (a little bit) more. The speakers felt like a gimmick before I made the purchase, and now my biggest regret is that I didn't get them with Transition Lenses, allowing them to be used indoors / at night.

Sure the speakers don't sound amazing, but they are good enough when it's mid-summer and you don't want headphones as well as sunglasses. 

Pricey? Sure. But it's also a fun companion for impromptu videos, and secret music listening!

### Verdict: 9/10
