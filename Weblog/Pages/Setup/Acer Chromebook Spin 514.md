## Acer Chromebook Spin 514

I've been rocking some Chromebook or another for around seven years, and honestly, it's a game-changer. I do *have* a Windows laptop (the HP Envy 15) that I take with me if I KNOW I'll need the horsepower on the go, but 99% of the time, ChromeOS handles everything I need. I bought the 514 specifically because I felt my old PixelBook getting sluggish with age. The 3:2 display was an absolute must for me, along with a fanless design.

I'd been hearing that the new Mediatek laptop chips were a massive improvement, and boy were they right. This Chromebook lasts forever, consistently over 10 hours of battery life, and is entirely silent whilst doing so!

I have frequently described ChromeOS as "The perfect secondary OS", and I still entirely stand by that. If I'm typing away at a document or doing some light development within Visual Studio (oh, didn't you know, Chromebooks come with full-on Linux), it is flawless. The pure simplicity of an OS not shackled down by decades of backwards compatibility means that ALWAYS snappy and ALWAYS efficient.

Ironically, the only way I was able to drain the battery at any sort of speed was plugging my phone into it. Tethering from a half-dead phone, my laptop started charging it. The only issue is that the Chromebook has a SMALLER battery than the Google Pixel 7 Pro. The battery life is so shockingly good that you'd never know it.

Is it the device that does everything I need it to 100% of the time? No. But it is the device that does 99% of what I need without ever complaining about it. That all being said, I still feel that a PixelBook with updated specs would be the perfect laptop. The Google Pixelbook is the golden standard for thin-and-light laptops, and putting an ARM processor there would make it INSANE.

### Verdict: 9/10
