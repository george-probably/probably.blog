I started my Logitech peripheral journey by buying a Logitech Craft back in 2017 (the one with the funky wheel). I absolutely loved the low-profile keys, and typing on it was an absolute joy.

I kept it for my move over to macOS, but I found that I was really struggling with the legend. On top of this, the battery wasn't lasting as long as it used to, so I decided to treat myself to the MX Keys.

I can't think of other peripheral combination that I'd rather use day-to-day, both for their flexibility and quality, but it is a shame that the new Logitech Options+ software has starting [shoehorning in AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaDT5YxMTfg). 

### Verdict: 9/10
