## Microsoft Xbox Series S

Bought for use alongside the Mac Studio, there is no denying that the Xbox Series S is the single easiest console to recommend right now. Words can't describe just how exceptionally tiny it is, especially considering the graphics horsepower it has. Much like my [Sony ZV-1](/setup/sony-zv-1), I seem to have bought this off of someone on eBay who didn't quite know what they had, as I got it for nearly half of the standard retail price! (the listing even called it an "Xbox **One** S")

I can't blame the person who listed it though, Microsoft seems entirely incapable to sticking to a firm naming scheme, how do you go from Xbox -> Xbox 360 -> Xbox One -> Xbox Series??? What does Xbox Series even mean???

Dumb name aside, modern comforts like quick-resume and a lightning fast SSD means that it is an absolute joy to game on. I will however still complain about the fact that you can't connect regular Bluetooth headsets, and if you want a wireless headset which works, you need one certified by Microsoft.

If you're intention is to get some light gaming done as you wait for videos to render out, you can't go wrong. Better still? Some games even support keyboard and mouse input!

### Verdict: 9/10
