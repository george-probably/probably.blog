## Logitech MX Master 3

Is there much to say about this? It's a mouse, that comes from a line of mice that has served me incredibly well for over SEVEN years now.

The extra buttons and horizontal scroll wheel make it an absolute joy to use. I no longer video-edit full time, but when I did, this mouse got me through it all.

Battery life is incredible, and when you do need to charge it, you don't need to worry about where the cable goes.

Side note on the above: It's funny to me how much people talk about the charge port on the Magic Mouse, whilst ignoring the fact that it is just a terrible mouse in the first place. The ergonomics of that thing are completely whack, and I get the beginings of hand cramp about 5 minutes into using it.

The only issue I have right now is that my current MX Master 3 is slightly falling apart, with the rubber wearing away. It's not an issue right now, but it does mean I'll keep an eye out if/when the MX Master 4 comes out.

### Verdict: 9/10
