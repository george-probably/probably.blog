## Nintendo Switch OLED

Since picking up the first Nintendo Switch, this has been a consistent companion on my travels. I'll only rarely use it docked, almost entirely on flights and train journeys, but it's perfect for that.

### Current time sinks:
- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
- Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
- Stardew Valley
- Into The Breach

I picked up the Switch OLED just before a long-term trip to Norway. It was priceless during the trip. I played Super Smash Bros Ultimate with friends. The larger, brighter screen makes the original Switch look more like a kids' toy than an actual games console. Still not happy about the lack of meaningful upgrade in computing power, but that's not where Nintendo normally competes.

The truth is - if you like Nintendo devices, this is an absolute hit. Have kids that you need to keep entertained on the go? Get them a Switch Lite. Want to experience Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on a gorgeous OLED screen when it comes out later this year? The Switch OLED is a no-brainer.

## Verdict: 9/10
