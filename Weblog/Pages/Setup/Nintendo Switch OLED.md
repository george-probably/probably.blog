## Nintendo Switch OLED

Since picking up the first Nintendo Switch, this has been a consistent companion on my travels. I'll only rarely use it docked, almost entirely on flights and train journeys, but it's perfect for that.

### Biggest time sinks:
- Rocket League
- Stardew Valley
- Motorsport Manager
- Into The Breach

I picked up the Switch OLED just before a long-term trip to Norway. It was priceless during the trip. I played Super Smash Bros Ultimate with friends. The larger, brighter screen makes the original Switch look more like a kids' toy than an actual games console. Still not happy about the lack of meaningful upgrade in computing power, but that's not where Nintendo normally competes.

## Verdict: 9/10
