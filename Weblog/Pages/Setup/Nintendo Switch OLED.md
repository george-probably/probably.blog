## Nintendo Switch OLED

<div class="img-container-wide"> <img alt="A picture of the Nintendo Switch OLED" src="https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/08_content_images/systems_5/nintendo_switch_3/nintendo_switch_oled/CI_NSwitch_big_screen_bg.png"> </div>

Since picking up the first Nintendo Switch, this has been a consistent companion on my travels. I'll only rarely use it docked, almost entirely on flights and train journeys, but it's perfect for that.

### Biggest time sinks:
- Rocket League
- Stardew Valley
- Motorsport Manager
- Into The Breach

I picked up the Switch OLED just before a long-term trip to Norway. It was priceless during the trip. I played Super Smash Bros Ultimate with friends. The larger, brighter screen makes the original Switch look more like a kids' toy than an actual games console. Still not happy about the lack of meaningful upgrade in computing power, but that's not where Nintendo normally competes.

## Verdict: 9/10
