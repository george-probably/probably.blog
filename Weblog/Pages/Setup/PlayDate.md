## PlayDate

I only received my PlayDate a few weeks ago, but I already see it as an irreplaceable part of my gaming life. For those who don't know: The PlayDate is a $179 handheld gaming console released by Panic. You'll know them from Nova, an excellent code editor for macOS, or publishing games like Untitled Goose Game and the award-winning Firewatch.

The Playdate isn't a console that will immerse you in graphically detailed worlds; the screen is a mere 400x240 pixels. Even more crazily than that, it's a 1-bit panel, meaning it's black and white! Despite the restraints, however, the quirkiness of the device has led to some very inventive problem-solving, and the device's simplicity is a large part of the charm.

It is **NOT** lost on me that you're paying basically the same amount as a Switch Lite for this thing. Still, it is worth noting that the PlayDate comes with a season of 24 games (two are delivered to you every single Monday for 12 weeks after first turning on the device). It's the device you get to remind yourself of the GameBoy you had as a kid, where you weren't trying to run a ray-traced game at 8K and complaining that your 4090 couldn't maintain 240FPS.  

### Verdict: 9/10
