## Steam Deck OLED

I consider this an evolution of my Switch OLED. It's that device, but with much more gaming horsepower, and with controllers that don't give you hand cramps if you hold it for too long.

### Current time sinks:
- Trackmania
- Stardew Valley
- Hades
- Vampire Survivors

The larger, brighter screen makes the Switch look more like a kids toy than an actual games console. For the games I play, and how I play them, it is the perfect device. All whilst still being easily upgradeable and repairable.

Ironically, if you're willing to sail the seas, it's also the best way to play games meant for the Nintendo Switch.

## Verdict: 9.5/10
