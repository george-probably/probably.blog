Bought as a cheap pair of headphones to use exclusively when I am playing on my Xbox, I have to say that  even though they aren't the best sounding or nicest built headphones I have ever used. However, [they are passable](https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/razer/kaira-x), and are an easy buy when they consistently cost [less than Â£35](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Razer-Kaira-Xbox-Gaming-Headset/dp/B097HLLS3S/).

Ultimately, they serve the purpose they have been bought for perfectly. The 4-5 hours a week I use them, they do the job. I have been considering an add-on for my Bose QuietComfort to make them usable on my Xbox, but have not been able to find a reliable option.
