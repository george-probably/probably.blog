It's a powerbank, with fast USB-C charging, and a QI pad. That's... about it. I keep it in my bag at all times, and it has been an absolute life saver! Indicator LEDs to show charge come in handy, and I have a tiny USB-C cable I leave in the pouch to make sure I'm always ready to juice up.

### Verdict: 8/10
