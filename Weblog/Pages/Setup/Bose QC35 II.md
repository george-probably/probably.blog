## Bose QC35 II

The Bose QC35 II are my go-to headphones when it comes to either long-term listening, or listening on-the-go. The noise cancelling is incredible, and the headphones themselves are super comfortable for extended wearing.

My #1 issue with them is that the leather ear cups are currently in the process of falling apart, but over 2 years into owning them, it's hard to complain.

I use them wirelessly with my phone / laptops, but also plugged in to my Mac Studio whenever I'm doing any work. They are the perfect over-ear companion. That being said, they are a little behind the curve.

If you want the same experience but newer, including a USB-C port instead of Micro-USB, I'd suggest the QC 45. If you want something that looks a little cooler, then go for the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. Finally, if you want something that isn't Bose at all, I recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.

### Verdict: 8/10

> Note: I didn't pay for the Bose QC35 II, they were sent to me by Google.
