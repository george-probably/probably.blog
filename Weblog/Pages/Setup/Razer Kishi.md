Sometimes even the Switch is too big to take with you, or the Switch just feels like overkill for your plans, so what do you do? The Razer Kishi!

It is basically a massive case for your phone complete with buttons and joysticks. The only issue? This is the v1, and it isn't *really* designed for larger phones. My S22 Ultra was at the very limit of what you could put in the Kishi, in fact, it always felt *super* sketchy stretching the Kishi to fit my phone.

My Pixel 7 Pro had a slightly different issue: The camera ledge would catch on the lip of the rubber grommet, so the top half of my phone wouldn't fit. Luckily, the solution was fairly simple: I took a pair of scissors and cut away part of the grommet.

Razer has since announced a Kishi v2, and honestly, the only reason I won't pick one up is that I use my current one way less than I thought I would when I first bought it. It's a super solid piece of kit that I just don't use that much.

### Verdict: 7.5/10
