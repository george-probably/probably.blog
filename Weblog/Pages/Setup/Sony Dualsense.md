## Sony Dualsense

Right about now you're probably thinking "George, your setup page clearly shows that you use an Xbox and don't own a Playstation... so why the Dualsense?" and that's a GREAT question! The truth this, this is currently my absolute favourite controller.

Of all of the current standard controllers, I find the Dualsense tot be the most comfortable to hold, and it connects to my Mac Studio via Bluetooth without requiring me to constantly be pairing between a console and the computer.

I also have this funky habit of tearing down controllers and taking out the vibration motors. Not because I actually believe the grams saved will turn me into an MLG, but because it's an excuse to be inside a piece of tech and poke around.

Finally: It lights up in RGB. What else do you want?

### Verdict: 9/10
