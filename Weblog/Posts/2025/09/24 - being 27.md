## The Year I Lost It All - Being 27
It's my birthday! I turned 28 today, and this has been a year of major changes. This year I realised that *I* am the mythical "future George" who has to get my life in order, so I did it. I have lost a lot (in a good way), so if you'll indulge me, please stick around for the next few paragraphs whilst I talk through it all.

### I lost over 28KG
This is easily the biggest win of the last 12 months. I have spent my whole life thinking health is something that "future George" can deal with. That current George should be able to enjoy anything he wants, and that future George should be the responsible one and pick up the pieces.

At the start of the year, a switch flicked in my head. I made the realisation that *I* am future George, and I have to be the one to deal with it. So, I cut out almost all of my snacking, and I weaponised my laziness. I started counting calories, not because I *really* care about how many calories I eat, but because if I wanted a snack I had to open the app, measure how much I was eating, look up the snack, enter the details... and that was all stuff I wasn't willing to do.

Through being more conscious about what I eat, I have benen able to shed 28KG in
