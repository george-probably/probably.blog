## I'm Tired.

> I have a few islands of thought that I can’t elegantly bridge right now, so I am offering them here in their raw form.

I'm Tired. Tired of not knowing who I am.

I'm Tired. Tired of this fake meritocracy. Most men **HAVE** to believe in the world being a perfect meritocracy, because the alternative is that the system not only *is* biased, but they are the ones that benefitted from it, and therefore they have not earned everything they have. It becomes more pronouced the further up the chain you go, such as with the uber-wealthy. “I succeeded because I worked so much harder than everyone else”, failing to acknowledge the sheer luck of it all.

It manifests in so many tiny ways. I've never had to worry about how my clothing would be percieved by others in the office. Or if the reason someone got a promotion over me was because he's "one of the lads". Or if my angry email at someone will mean that I am now labelled "emotional".

I'm Tired. Tired of pretending I'm okay. It's not just that I'm unhappy, it's that I'm not sure if I even have the capacity for genuine long-term happiness. I have happy moments, but the higher the high, the deeper the crash.

Do I deserve the friends I have?

I'm Tired. Tired of caring. I often say that all it would take is for me to be a significantly less moral person, and I'd easily be rich. Let's be honest, scam call centers clearly aren't struggling financially. Maybe I'd pump-and-dump a crypto currency. Hell, I could go really far off the deep end and do some black-hat hacking.

The reason I don't do any of these things is that I find it hard enough to sleep at night as it is. I don't need the added weight of knowing someone trusted me and I abused that trust.

I'm Tired. Tired of watching the world burn.

I'm Tired. Tired of being tired. I feel wary calling it a "New Year's Resolution", because I didn't come into 2025 intending on resolving to do anything. It was more that I looked down at a calendar and thought to myself "Fuck, it's 2025, and I still haven't gotten all of my shit together."

Most of my bad habits aren't conscious choices. When I bite my nails it's because I've got nothing else to do with my hands. When I overeat it's because I put a full bowl of M&Ms on my desk, and by the time I've consciously clocked that I've had any, it turns out I've eaten them all.

Because of that, getting myself together is less about changing who or what I am, and more about being aware of my actions. If I want some chocolate, it's about being conscious of the fact I'm eating it, and enjoying the amount I have. Not having as much as I can before it's either all gone or I feel sick. I mentally call myself out when I notice I'm about to start biting my nails. I've started seeing a therapist to get my mind straight.

I can't make **THE** world a better place, but I can try to make **MY** world a better place.
