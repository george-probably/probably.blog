> I have a few islands of thought that I can’t elegantly bridge right now, so I am offering them here in their raw form.

I'm Tired. Tired of not knowing who I am.

I'm Tired. Tired of pretending I'm okay.

---

I'm Tired. Tired of caring.

---

I'm Tired. Tired of watching the world burn.

I'm Tired. Tired of being tired. I feel wary calling it a "New Year's Resolution", because I didn't come into 2025 intending on resolving to do anything. It was more that I looked down at a calendar and thought to myself "Fuck, it's 2025, and I still haven't gotten all of my shit together."

Most of my bad habits aren't conscious choices. When I bite my nails it's because I've got nothing else to do with my hands. When I overeat it's because I put a full bowl of M&Ms on my desk, and by the time I've consciously clocked that I've had any, it turns out I've eaten them all.

Because of that, getting myself together is less about changing who or what I am, and more about being aware of my actions. If I want some chocolate, it's about being conscious of the fact I'm eating it, and enjoying the amount I have. Not having as much as I can before it's either all gone or I feel sick.

I can't make **THE** world a better place, but I can try to make **MY** world a better place.
