Linux on desktop has been something I've dabbled in on-and-off for years. I've had a USB with a live image of Ubuntu on it for messing around with on older hardware for as long as I can remember, but I've never been able to use it as my full-time OS for multiple reasons, those being...

Thanks to the incredible work from Valve on their Proton Compatibility Layer, there are some scenarios where running games on Linux is actaully MORE efficient, AND gets you more FPS than using Windows natively. I don't know how the wizards over there have done it, but Steam contains 95% of the games I play. Most importantly, it features Rocket League, the single game I play most on desktop.

### Microsoft Desktop Suite
It's hard when most of your job is working on Word Documents or Excel Spreadsheets to not have easy access to those software packages. I have however learned to work with a combination of OpenOffice and Office for Web to make it all work - including using the Outlook PWA!

I am a big fan of PWAs (I've been using a Chromebook of some form for years, so have learned to love them), and actually also have some installed for:
- Google Messages
- Photopea
- Snapchat
- Whatsapp
- YouTube
- YouTube Music
