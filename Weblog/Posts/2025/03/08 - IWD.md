## International Women's Day 2025

Women exist and spend on average 2.8 hours more per dadoing unpaid care and domestic work. ðŸš¨HOT TAKE ALERTðŸš¨That is not okay. I am  lucky to have a lot of inspirational women in my life, so letâ€™s take a moment to celebrate some of my favourites!

Euge one of the most dedicated doggy mommies Iâ€™ve ever seen. I wish I had someone looking at me the way Sephy looks at you.

Alex thank you for being an absolutely incredible partner in crime, always getting up to random funky fun with me at a momentâ€™s notice.

Emma is such an immensely talented, smart, funny, hard-working friend. Thank you for wrangling the group and keeping us on-project. Everything would be chaos without you.

Syd youâ€™re always so willing to help, whether it be looking after me when I come and visit, or being an armchair therapist me when I need someone to vent to (and my actual therapist is busy). 

![Kate smiling and holding her London Marathon 2024 completion medal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/george-probably/probably.blog/main/Images/iwd/Kate.webp)
Kate is always willing to call me out for my shit, challenge me, and push me to do better. With more willpower and talent in one finger than I have in my entire body. Oh, and she wonâ€™t tell you this herself, but she even ran a fricking marathon!

![Sally smiling and holding a boquet of flowers.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/george-probably/probably.blog/main/Images/iwd/Sally.webp)
Last, and definitely not least, my incredible mum. I canâ€™t begin to imagine the strength and bravery it takes to leave your life behind and move to another country where you donâ€™t know anyone, all so you can give the best possible life to your kids.

You all inspire me each and every date to be a better version of myself.
And, since someone will need to hear this: Womenâ€™s rights are human rights. Itâ€™s not a zero sum game, and holding women up isnâ€™t dragging men down.
Kindness binds us.
