## Do I Live Forever, Fade Away, or Go Out With a Bang?
This is something I ask myself all of the time regarding my digital presence. How do I treat it long term? It's not an issue for today, or tomorrow. It's a somewhat more existential one. One that implies that others would even care what happens in the first place, so why don't you indulge me for a bit whilst I run through all of the permutations of my digital existence.

### Live Forever
This is the hardest, eternal slog against the entropy of the universe. Sure, I can but a domain for the next 100 years, and host my blog on that, but who renews it in 100 years time? Weblog.lol almost certainly won't exist in 100 years (sorry Adam), so do I host somewhere else? How do I know it will actually last any longer?

Let's pretend I find someone to keep my domain active, and a host to keep all of my stuff on. So what's next? Surely there comes a point where people don't actually read blogs any more, or maybe the English language changes and morphs so much that my ramblings are even more meaningless than usual. It's a constand fight against an unending force, and every win is temporary. Anyone can win, but many don't win for long.

There WILL come a point, even further into the future, where it won't be possible anyway. Maybe humanity collapses, or nuclear war destroys the planet, or AI takes over the world and decides my writings are of no real value. Even if it's not any of those, it'll will still happen even later with the heatdeath of the universe. There will come a point where the universe is just... dust.

### Fade Away
In that case, maybe the easiest course of action is to do nothing. One day, I stop blogging. A few months or years later, I let the domain expire, and my dissappearance will be roughly as noteworthy as my appearance (that is to say, not very).

I'd be giving in to the churn of entropy, but that's fine. Lots of YouTube channels, or podcasts, or blogs just stop one day. After all, there was a day during your childhood when you were called home for dinner, said "see you tomorrow" to your friends, and that tomorrow never came.

### Go Out With a Bang!
So why don't I embrace the chaos, go out on my own terms? Decide when enough is enough, and [ride off into the sunset strapped to a helicopter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DKv5H5Frt0). The truth is, most people don't get that opportunity. Even if they did, would it feel... genuine? 

The risk is that it comes across as me trying to get praise whilst still here.
