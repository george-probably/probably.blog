## Keeping myself accountable - the forced timetable.

Assuming the world hasn't ended, this should be 7th week in a row that I have posted something on this weblog (ignoring some pre-launch test posts). Firstly: if you're reading this, thank you! Honestly? This is primarily a space for me to satisfy my need to rant about some of the weirdest stuff, so if you find it enjoyable, I am eternally grateful.

Secondly: How am I doing this? I have never been known to be particularly consistent, and this will make it two months-ish in a row without incident. The secret? I schedule these posts way in advance. It's currently the 20th of January as I write this, but here's the thing: I will probably stop writing this post after this sentence. Why? Because I haven't finished the post going out in 11.5 hours. This post is due to go up on the 24th of February, and regardless of whether or not I finish it, it **will** go live.

This stead-fastness ensures that I have to write something, not because I've got something grand to say (That being said: ideation and titling for posts happens weeks in advance. If you want to see stuff in the pipeline, you can take a sneak peek [in the Github repo](https://snpy.tech/github)), but because this is as much a writing exercise as it is a cathartic rant space.
