## Twitch is easier for women… until it isn’t.

Three serious posts in, this might be the one that gets me straight-up cancelled right here. That said, this post is just a culmination of conversations I've had with many big and small streamers over the last few years. It's a sobering look at some trends that show the psyche of the average Twitch viewer. 

### The Internet is down bad

The proliferation of OnlyFans & Fansly... To be clear: I believe that this is work in the same way as any other content creator, and they should be respected as such...

Women are more likely to get explosive growth as men vie for attention. Donating is a way to get recognition, and they feel it could lead to a relationship.

![A tweet from @KEEMSTAR which reads: "Clearly husband is abusing. She showed the text. But Amouranth herself has scammed so many guys online claiming she was single for years. These twitch streamers dont care about their viewers. They all just use you & your low IQs to fill their pockets."](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfNa8R_UcAAmvPx?format=png)<div class="caption">Tweet image taken from [@JakeSucky](https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1581709055726231555), the original tweet has been deleted.</div>

When Amouranth came out and shared that she had a husband who had been abusive, some men felt she had "lied to them" for not telling them that she wasn't available and for "leading them on"

This exponential growth also means that the bell curve is exaggerated

### Bros just hanging out

On the other hand, men don't get the same kind of attention. Their growth is a lot slower, but that also means that it's more sustainable. Why? Because their audience tends to be other guys who just want to hang out.

### The Atrioc Situation

Anyone who follows the GitHub (or has read some previous posts), will know that this post has been in the works for weeks. That being said, something happened whilst writing this that I can't just ignore. The fact of the situation is: Twitch streamer Atrioc was caught paying for Deepfaked nudes of fellow streamers on the platform. He claims it was a one-off, and that it wasn't anyone he knew personally, but it is still disgusting.

That being said, I'm just *some guy* talking about it, and frankly how I feel about this situation doesn't matter. He has caused genuine pain to people he called his friends, and if you see any way of defending what he has done, I kindly invite you to leave and never come back.

To this end, here are some tweets and videos from those affected:
