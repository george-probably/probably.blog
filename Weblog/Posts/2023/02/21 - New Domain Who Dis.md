## New domain, who dis?
Howdy, all! Consider this more of a little announcement post than anything else, but: I decided that [chachanidze.com](https://chachanidze.com) was a domain only a mother could love, or in this case, spell. I've wanted a use for my surname as a domain for ages and loved the idea of having my weblog on it, but I think it's not practical.

That's why if you are looking in the address bar right now you'll see that it is [probably.blog](https://probably.blog) instead! I had considered buying `probably.is` instead, but Namecheap seemingly pulled some weird shenanigans so I decided against it, plus I feel like [probably.blog](https://probably.blog) fits the site better!

On the subject of the site: the post that didn't turn up last week is still on its way, it is a sensitive subject that I want to handle with care and I am looking forward to everyone seeing it on Friday!

In other news: I bought myself a [Red Nose for Comic Relief](https://shop.comicrelief.com/products/rnd23-red-nose)! The noses have gone through [a major redesign](https://www.comicrelief.com/rednoseday/noses), and the new versions are designed by none other than ex-Apple designer Sir Jony Ive! Red Nose Day was always one of those things I loved as a kid (mostly for the Doctor Who specials), and if you want to watch me make a really dumb unboxing video, you can see it below!
