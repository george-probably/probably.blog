### Camera Talk
I'm going to start this by saying just one thing: a 200MP primary rear camera is insane. I don't know whether it's good insane or bad insane yet, but either way it is absolutely wild. Samsung has a slight tendency of chasing the biggest numbers, and figuring it out later. Famously, the S20 Ultra never lived up to its potential as high shutter lag and terrible auto-focus meant that the 108MP main shooter wouldn't actually capture the things you wanted (unless you were looking for a blurry mess).

The default pictures you take are binned all the way down to 12.5MP, but you can go into the settings and choose between taking 50MP or even the full 200MP photos. Disclaimer: There's a tonne of processing that happens on 200MP photos, and after you click the shutter you **will** have to wait a few seconds as that processing happens before taking another picture.

The selfie camera has been "downgraded" to a native 12MP shooter, but the practical result should be more low-light performace and quicker processing as it's no longer binning 40MP shots.

Finally: The 8K video is no longer the cinematic 24fps, as the S23 Ultra can film at a full 30fps. I still don't know who's using their phone to film 8k footage, but hey, it's an option!

### European Parity
Aside from that, my only other major reaction is: **FINALLY**. Here in the UK at least, we finally look set to get a Samsung flagship with a Qualcomm chip. Though, it's not just any chip. Following in the footsteps of Apple and Microsoft in wanting chips that are practically the same as the off-the-shelf counterpart, but also with a name that means it's no one else's, the S23 line will launch with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy. What does this mean in practice? It's a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, but with a slight overclock.

Other than that, the hardware is mostly the same. The same 5000mAh battery, the same S-Pen, and the same 45W fast charging. It's a fairly safe route that Samsung is taking with this cycle, and it makes sense considering the success of the S22 Ultra. That being said, the one thing that isn't the same is the price tag. 

## S23 / S23+

These are the phones that I think 99% of people should buy, and the S22+ specifically looks to be a super decent deal. The battery capacity has been upped to 4700mAh, and in combination with the dramatically more efficient SoC, we should see much better battery life. The reason the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 was so much more efficient than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 was Qualcomm's move away from Samsung's 4nm process to TSMC's. Samsung could never quite match the efficiency of TSMC, and that showed both in the Snapdragon, but also in the Exynos 2200.

The Gorilla Glass Victus 2 fronted displays are as AMOLED as ever, getting up to 120hz. The design has been moved to be more in line with the S23 Ultra. Sure, they're still more rounded than the Note-esque flagship, but they now feel like a cohesive family with matching camera modules.

The truth is, we're at a point where it is surprisingly hard to buy an outright _bad_ phone. Any flagship phone, whether it be from Samsung, Google, Xiaomi, Apple, or even OnePlus (more about them on Friday) will be sufficient for a regular user.

## Galaxy Book3 Series

With no new wearables launching (either in the form of headphones or watches), the only other major announcement was the new series of Galaxy Book laptops. They're a jumble of the words "3", "360", "Pro", and "Ultra', so pick the combination you like and there will be your next laptop. Frankly, I'm mostly just embarrassed that Samsung thought "Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360" was an acceptable name for a device.

The one feature I do miss, less so for the practicality and more for the fun quirkiness, is the Qi Wireless Charger that used to be built into the trackpad, allowing you to place your phone, earbuds, or even watch on the trackpad

They only come in 1 size, 15″ for the Book 3 / Book 3 360 and 16″ Book 3 Pro / Book 3 Pro 360 / Book 3 Ultra. The screens aren't particularly bright, at a fairly embarrassing 500 nits of peak brightness for the two Pro models. This isn't too bad if you're just using it indoors, but the fact that they call it "HDR" is a stretch. They all have 13th-Generation Intel processors inside, only the Ultra has any form of dedicated graphics. 

Honestly, Windows laptops just aren't that interesting to me right now. I've talked about it on my [Acer Chromebook Spin 514](/setup/acer-chromebook-spin-514) page, but ChromeOS is the perfect secondary OS. If you're looking for a computer to double as at home PC and on-the-go powerhouse, the truth is that nothing can quite compete with the Apple Silicon Macs. If it has to be Windows, nothing about the Galaxy Book 3 series jumps out at me as a reason to get it over something either more powerful (like the [Razer Blade 16](https://www.razer.com/gb-en/gaming-laptops/Razer-Blade-16/RZ09-0483TWH3-R3W1)), more repairable (like the [Framework](https://frame.work)), or less expensive (like the [Asus Vivobook 15X OLED](https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/vivobook/vivobook-15x-oled-x1503-12th-gen-intel/)).

## The Bigger Picture - Are Samsung in Trouble?

This Unpacked happens to come off the back of a very weak quarter from Samsung. In the last 3 months, the company made a profit of $8.5 billion, which sounds like a lot until you realise that it's a 69% decrease from the year prior. (major yikes!) The crazier part is that their revenue only dropped by around 9%, meaning the drop in profits have come from increasing costs.

During 2022, Samsung's operating profit fell by a (relatively) small 16% to $35.2 billion from the previous year, but crucially: the part of the company that sells chips took the hardest hit. Their operating profit sank an unprecedented 96.9%, mostly due to a rapidly shrinking memory market.
