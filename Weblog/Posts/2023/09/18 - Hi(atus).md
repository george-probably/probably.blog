## Hi(atus)

> Full disclosure: I first came up with that insanely cringeworthy title, and am now writing this post. Also - this was supposed to be my first post back, but a Reason kinda happened.

It has been a few ~~days~~? ~~weeks~~? months(!) since I last posted. In that time: I've pivoted jobs (and industries), moved twice (don't ask), and... [bought even more domains](https://probably.green)!

It has been draining and has meant I haven't really had time to write posts, but I'm happy to say I'm back!

I even have a fun little announcement: One of the domains I bought was [probably.fm](https://probably.fm). The goal is to use it to host audio versions of all of my posts. It won't be anything *too* fancy, just me reading it into a microphone and making sure the audio is balanced. Sometimes, I may add a bit of nuance here or there, but the core idea is that it is for those who aren't able (or willing) to read posts.

As well as the site, it'd be available via RSS, so you could (theoretically) just get either the text RSS or audio RSS straight to your device!

I even have a quick-and-dirty proof of concept audio [available here](https://social.lol/@georgeprobably/111060079327776713). Disclaimer, it was made start-to-finish in 15 minutes, including the fact it was recorded in an echoey room directly into my S23 Ultra. I do have a proper audio setup, but moving and all that means the setup isn't set up.

OH - there's also [probably.pics](https://probably.pics), but I'm sure you can guess what that will be once I have it up and running.

Also: I've missed y'all. Let me know how you've been by @ing me [on mastodon](https://social.lol/@georgeprobably) :)
