## Showing Setup to Socially Sway Society 

I've had a bit of a hectic week, so the in-depth post initially planned for this week will instead come in a couple of weeks (next week's post is time sensitive, so it will come after that). Instead, I have something a little more light-hearted and casual! Regular readers will see a new button in the menu, titled "Setup".

Want to know the gear I rock, how much I like it, and why? That's the place to see it all! Within the table, you can click on a product name to see a mini-review of the products. Even calling it that is a *bit* of a stretch; it's more of an informal look into why I use what I do, and how I make it usable. For example, the [Mac Studio page](/setup/apple-mac-studio) features a list of all the software I use to make macOS more powerful!

If you'd like to discuss more, you can always reach me on Mastodon at [@georgeprobably@social.lol](https://social.lol/@georgeprobably) but remember to keep the conversation civil! Just because I like it doesn't mean you're not allowed to prefer something else (though, if anyone unironically says the words "not a retina display", I will freak out). I need to make the pages prettier (adding an image at the top, so it's not just a wall of text), but it's functionally all there. I'm slowly adding more devices, so please be patient!

You can *either* see this as "glass half empty" with no *real* post this week or "glass half full", as I've got 12 pages worth of setup content.

### Blog Redesign

I've wanted to do this since day one, I haven't done any serious coding of any form in about five years, and my CSS was terrible even at my peak, so the look we had was about as good as I could pull off. Well? After spending lots of time trying to make Flex work the way I want, we now have two columns! This means I can add more things without looking dumb, so there's a search box to find specific posts, and the page will re-size to fit onto a mobile device.

I'm sure that this is the kind of thing that most people who are even slightly technical will scoff at, but it's nice to be able to slowly get back towards something I enjoyed doing before I got burnt out on. (Maybe a topic for a later post?)

You may have also noticed some tweaks to the colours used. I did this to improve readability and make the differences between light and dark modes way more obvious. I talked about it more in this thread:

>Note: Obviously I'm not *actually* trying to sway society into using all of the things I use in a synical plot to make what I like more popular... or am I?
