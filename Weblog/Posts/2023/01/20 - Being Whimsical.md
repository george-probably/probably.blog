# Adding More Whimsy To Your Life

If you've looked in the footer of this blog, you'll have seen that it's hosted on [weblog.lol](https//weblog.lol). This falls under the larger unbrella of [omg.lol](https://omg.lol), a collection of web tools that creator Adam Newbold (@Neatnik) thought would be useful. The reality, however, is that it is much more than than. In creating this service, Adam has found a way to bring together a community of passionate tinkerers, who reside within an IRC channel (bridge to a Discord server, just in case you're not **that** technical).

Why do I mention all of this? Well, with the world seemingly become a more serious and dark place with every passing moment, these services (and the communities that thrive along with them) provide a light to help keep that darkness at bay. Whether it be thanks to the cute logo (known as Prami), the community, or just the fact that Adam himself is always willing to help you solve any issues you may have.

There are a few other products and services that seem to thrive on whimsy, so if you need to take a moment and stop taking things so seriously, here are some things that will help take your mind off of the world:

## #1 - PlayDate

I only recieved my PlayDate a few weeks ago, but I already see it as an irreplaceable part of my gaming life. For those who don't know: The PlayDate is a $179 handheld gaming console that was released by Panic. You'll know them from Nova, an awesome code editor for macOS, or from publishing games like Untitled Goose Game and the award-winning Firewatch. How do I know Firewatch is award winning? I actually interviewed James Benson, an animator at Campo Santo (the studio behind Firewatch) after they won a Golden Joystick for Best Indie Game, [you can see that (very chaotic) video here](https://youtu.be/W-wYWfAuag8)!

Full disclosure: The Playdate isn't a console which will be getting you immersed in graphically detailed worlds, in fact, the screen is a mere 400x240 pixels, and even more crazily, it's a 1-bit panel, meaning it's black and white! Despite the restraints however, the quirkiness of the device has led to some very inventive problem solving, and the simplicity of the device is a large part of the charm.

It is **NOT** lost on me that you're paying basically the same amount as a Switch Lite for this thing, but it is worth noting that the PlayDate actually comes with a season of 24 games (two are delievered to you ever single Monday for 12 weeks after first turning on the device). It's the device you get to remind yourself of the GameBoy you had as a kid, where you weren't trying to run a ray-traced game at 8K and complaining that your 4090 couldn't maintain 240FPS.

## #2 - 







## #5 - omg.lol

I want to wrap this up by quickly bringing it full circle. When I first signed up to [omg.lol](https://omg.lol), it was actually because I just needed something to host what I call my "digital business card", it's basically like a linktree but also with direct contact info, a link I have stored on an NFC chip on a ring, so I can give someone my contact details in a fast-paced environment.

The reason I finally took the plunge was that I discovered they also offered vanity URLs (in this case, called pURLs). You ever notice how every Snappy-Tech link I share is `snpy.tech/whatever`? That's how that happens! omg.lol was an excuse for me to consolidate those multiple services into one, allowing me to pay less whilst getting the same amount done.
