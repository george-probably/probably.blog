## Reason #23: An Act of Kindness (and chocolate)
With Easter just around the corner - I have been doing something fairly selfish. Instead of doing the thing that normal people do, and buying chocolate Easter eggs, I have been buying bars of [Tony's Chocolate](https://tonyschocolonely.com/uk/en). Why? Well, aside from the incredible work they do to ensure their cocoa is 100% slave-free and working with farmers directly to pay them a living wage, it's mostly because it's *actually* good chocolate.

Easter eggs are awkward, large, expensive and often underwhelming when it comes to the actual quality of the chocolate. With Tony's, I can buy a few bars and have them in my bag at all times, handing them out to anyone I run into who seems like they would enjoy it.

It's not all easy for anyone I gift the chocolate though - it comes with a condition! The condition is that they **MUST** share the chocolate with someone else, and share the kindness. It's easier said than done when their chocolate tastes that good.
