# The Reason #3: Work
This may sound a bit weird, but hear me out: There is something about being properly stuck into work that I love.

I am a Student Ambassador for the Go Global scheme at Bath Spa University. What this means is I try to convince people to get as far away from England (and by extension, Bath Spa) as possible.

I talk to students about what they're studying, and where they may want to go for a semester abroad. Some choose the US, others go to Australia, and a few ever follow my lead and go to Norway.

This kind of time chatting with people is always really inspiring. So many different people with hopes and dreams, knowing that I am helping them decide where to know and (hopefully) helping them to have an incredible time whilst out there.

### It's not exclusive to ambassadorship though
Even when video editing, I feel my sense of time warp and disappear. I've been known to sit down at the start of the day to edit, and then snap back to reality 12 hours later having spent the whole day editing.

The time will pass so quickly that I don't feel tired or hungry until I suddenly realise that it is 11pm and I haven't eaten anything all day.

Sure, I dislike the *idea* of work. If you ask me, I'll say that I'd happily be a stay-at-home dad, and waking up at 2pm is great and all, but there is no denying that doing *some* work gives me a sense of purpose.
