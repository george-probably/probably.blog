## Reason #9: Red Nose Day
Few moments are as prominent in the mind of young George that the joy of Red Nose Day. [Comic Relief](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Comic_Relief), a biennial-turned-annual charity event (previously alternating with [Sport Relief](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sport_Relief)), is one of those core memories that sticks around in my head.

The reason was always sort of selfish. There would be a Doctor Who-related sketch, meaning I got a little bit of extra content, and also seeing people in plastic red noses was always funny. On that note:

You may notice that the red nose I'm wearing in the picture above isn't plastic. That's because this year they were re-designed by none other than [Sir Jony Ive](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jony_Ive). If that name somehow means nothing to you, you may know him from the teeny tiny small niche products he has designed. Things like the iPhone, iPad, iPod, iMac, and iThinkiHaveMadeMyPoint.

The new red noses are made of paper and give the feel of something designed by Sir Jony Ive. Though it has been a while since I actively followed the work of Comic Relief, something about the new red noses got me really excited. I wasn't the only one - the new red noses were actually quite hard to get ahold of, and I even sent some to America because I had friends who wanted to get hands-on with them!

Red Nose Day encapsulates the simplicity of childhood and is an opportunity to relish in what is ultimately a night filled with dumb jokes, whilst raising money for good causes. If you're in the UK, you can [watch the full broadcast on BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001k32p).
