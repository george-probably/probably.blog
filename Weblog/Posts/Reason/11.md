## Reason #11: Subset Games
This is a bit of a weird one - but I have recently gotten back into games developed by Subset Games. I was watching my friend [Krayven](https://twitch.tv/krayven) streaming [Faster Than Light](https://subsetgames.com/ftl.html) on Twitch, and I realised it had been a while since I had played the game.

FTL is one of my favourite games of all time, described as a '"spaceship simulation roguelike-like" [which] allows you to take your ship and crew on an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy filled with glory and bitter defeat.' Better still - it's currently under Â£2 [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/)!

There have been many attempts to copy the charm of FTL, but no one has quite managed to match the balance of the original.

Their follow-up game, [Into The Breach](https://subsetgames.com/itb.html), isn't as universally loved. It's a different style of game, but I love it just as much as FTL. So much so that I own it on 3 separate platforms. Android (included with Netflix Games), [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/into-the-breach-switch/), and [PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into_the_Breach/)!

I love both games deeply, and I have accidentally lost many hours to both games. Especially over the last week.
