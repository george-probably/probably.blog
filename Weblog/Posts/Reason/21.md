## Reason #21: Bubble Tea
Remember how three weeks ago I talked about how sometimes it's as simple as a Tropical Twist-flavoured Fanta? This isn't quite like that.

Few things hit me in the nostalgia feels as hard as bubble tea does. It reminds me of my time living in Hong Kong, and the crazy experiences I had there. 

It's weird how a simple drink can do that, every time I have one I feel like I'm re-remembering things I haven't thought about in 13 years. Side note: how has it been 13 years since I came back from Hong Kong???

Anyway, a drink WITH a snack included? How could you ever go wrong. If you've never had a bubble tea before, this is your sign to do so!
