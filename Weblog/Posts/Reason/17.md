## Reason #17: #288CF0
The colour I refer to as "Snappy-Tech Blue" is a colour that I have been using for around 10 years now. Whether it be in the Snappy-Tech logo, or part of the theme on this site, it has been a core part of my personal brand for so long that I can't really think of a time before it.

Nowadays, I have tattoos in blue to match, and the usage of the colour has almost become a bit of a cliche. The origins however are very humble. I was messing around within Photoshop and wanted a colour I could easily remember. Sure, the hex code `#288CF0` isn't particularly memorable, but do you know what is? RGB values of 40, 140, and 240 respectively. For a while, I even used `#F08C28` as the Snappy-Tech orange! 

Sure - it's just a shade of blue, but after all of these years it's _my_ shade of blue, even if no one else will ever call it "Snappy-Tech Blue". Looking at this page in light mode? The background is Snappy-Tech Blue! If you're using dark mode, then it's the borders.
