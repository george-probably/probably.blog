## Reason #22: A Catch-Up Call
![A screenshot of George and his friend on a Snapchat video call, with a crying face filter on George.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/george-probably/chachanidze.com/main/Images/lulu.webp)<div class="caption">A screenshot of my friend and me on a Snapchat Video call. <br/> _Note: There is a Snapchat filter on my face, I'm not actually crying_</div>

A lot of my friends are geographically distant from me. It's a side effect of my lifestyle, the longest I have lived in any one place is the last 3 years I have spent in Bath, and even then, I spent 6 months of that in Norway (where I met the friend I am catching up with in the screenshot above).

Though we try our best to keep in touch, the reality of life is that we sometimes have our own things to deal with, and can't quite be as talkative as we'd like. You add the complexity of time zones on top of that and it's an uphill battle all of the way. It's why these phone calls mean so much to me.

Even when they're short, they are a lovely window into what my friends are doing, and it helps to cleanse my soul.
