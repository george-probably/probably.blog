## Reason #13: Daddy's Dim Sum
Some days are hard. Today was one of them. I've been feeling a bit sick, and has meant I've spent the day not really doing much.

Self care today has been ordering from a local dim sum place called... Daddy's Dim Sum. The name is a bit sus, but the dim sum is really nice. 

I've ordered from the place two times before, but somehow they managed to get the order wrong both times. Not that the food was bad, just not what I had ordered. Luckily - third time's the charm, and I got exactly as I ordered!

I guess this is your reminder that sometimes self care is eating delicious food, and that's completely okay. Do what's right for you.

### Today was a 5/10
