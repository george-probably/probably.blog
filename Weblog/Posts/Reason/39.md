## Reason #39: Long Lost Podcasts

Years ago I produced something called the "Snappy-Tech Podcast". It ran for 40 episodes and was mostly just an excuse for me to sit down with some friends and talk vaguely about the tech news.

It was a lot of fun, but I had to stop in the end as there is a lot more production that goes on behind the scenes than you'd think!

That being said: There was one episode that was never widely distributed. Episode #28 was streamed exclusively on Twitch, and was never shared more broadly... until now!

It was a panel discussion about gaming, Twitch, and more with input from game developers, content creators, and even a Twitch employee! It's still super relevant, so [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWOg0JaN188) to give it a watch (or listen)!

There's also an embed below:
