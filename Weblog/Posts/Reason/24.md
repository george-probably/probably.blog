## Reason #24: The Parental Unit
With Easter happening next week, I am back in London visiting my parents for a couple of days. Why only two days? Well, because they're heading off to Japan tomorrow! They're going to see my sister for a few weeks, who is out there doing a work placement at a facility specialising in cancer research (yes, as if being the prettier one wasn't good enough, she's the smarter one too).

Spending a few days with them is really lovely - there's something about your parent's fridge that makes it magically full all of the time. Also: meals are just magically cooked at regular times, and laundry just gets done???

On a serious note: I do actually love spending time with my family. They are some of the funniest, kindest, most insane people I know, and every moment with them is eventful. I plan on waking up in just over 6 hours to watch Formula 1 with my dad.

Oh, he also accidentally bought a Â£16k car last week, but that's a story for a different time. That also isn't the craziest thing I've known him to do.

### Today was a 6/10
