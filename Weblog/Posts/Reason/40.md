## Reason #40: Raisin (a baby)

Oh hey, it has been a whole month since I posted one of these! It's not that I haven't had reasons, it's that I have been too busy to write any of them.

A couple of weeks ago, my cousin gave birth to a beautiful daughter called Anastasia. For those of you who don't know, I have very close connections to my extended family, and my cousin is like a sister to me, so I went home to help for a little bit.

Spending the time helping out has been the perfect soul clense after a super busy month, and leaving her to go back to Bath to sort some stuff out has been heartbreaking. I can't wait to go back home and see her again. The rest of my family are alright too.

OH, and the name of this post? Well, I thought it'd be funny to tell people her name is "Kishmish", a traditional Georgian name which has been passed through many generations. The reality? Kishmish is just the Georgian word for raisin.
