## Reason #44: 26

It was my 26th birthday over the weekend. Every year I joke about now I feel really old now, and don't get me wrong, I did that again, but this year was different.

If you had asked me 7 months ago, I would have never expected to get to my birthday (see [reason 41](/reason/41)). Now that I'm here, it feels... weird. I've had a cold for the last few days, and I've been in Cyprus for a wedding so I haven't really had the chance to celebrate it.

It has all felt really introspective, and I've felt the need to ask myself whether or not I'll make it to 27.

The truth is: I don't know. And I don't mean that in a depressed way, I mean that in a "for all I know I could get hit by a bus tomorrow" kind of way. Yet, weirdly, if I did get hit by a bus tomorrow I'd be at peace with it. 

I've never really been afraid of death as a concept, I mean, it wouldn't change anything if I was. 

I guess I just have a lot on my mind, and my exhausted social battery combined with jetlag from ~~3~~ 2 days in Cyprus (more on that tomorrow) have me excited for a weekend where I do absolutely nothing when it's only Tuesday.
