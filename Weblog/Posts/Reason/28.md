## Reason #28: Unexpected Sleep
The eagle eyed amongst you will notice that I didn't have a reason yesterday. This wasn't intentional - I got into bed at 7pm planning on having a quick nap before getting back up and doing some work.

Unfortunately, what was supposed to be a short nap instead ended up as a 12 hour long sleep, so now it's 7am and I have a lot of things to get done!

Taking the silver linings out of the situation however, I *have* now fixed my sleep schedule. Right until the moment I break it again, that is.

And hey - It's still yesterday somewhere (barely).

### Today was a 6/10
