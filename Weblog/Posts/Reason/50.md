## Reason #50: Robb

I have often talked about how I have some truly amazing friends, and I think it's only fair I give you an example. [Robb](https://robb.omg.lol/), also known in the omg.lol community as RKnight, is one of those people. Let's talk about why.

### probably.green
A few years back, and with what was one of my very first interactions with Robb, I mentioned that I had bought the domain `probably.green` (no longer owned by me). This was because of a colour I had seen mentioned on [My Modern Met](https://mymodernmet.com/color-perception-optical-illusion/). I thought that having it full-screen under that domain would be a funny joke, and as I had no way of actioning it beyond just buying the domain, Robb immediately stepped in to make it happen. He let me point my domain in the direction of his Netlify and just dealt with it.

He didn't ask for so much as a thank you, and it was a gesture that meant a lot more to me than he probably realises.

### Stickers
I am *really* bad at following what other people are doing creatively. I am **ALWAYS** down to support a friend with a small business, be it selling stickers, candles, or a subscription service. I am proud of my friends, and want them to succeed, so I never ask for "mates rates", and make a point to pay for the products they provide.

When I found out that Robb had some INCREDIBLE [stickers](https://rknight.me/shop/), it was because someone had mentioned it in the omg.lol Discord, so I sent a sarcastic "I can has?".

This was more my way of saying I had been looking for the link to buy the stickers, but without hesitation Robb immediately sent me a text offering to send them free-of-charge. I flatly declined, and insisted on paying for them, but the fact he even offered shows just how kind he is.

### RecentFM
Robb made a SUPER convenient script called [RecentFM](https://recentfm.rknight.me/). This lets you embed a link which checks your LastFM page and presents the most recent song. Super handy, with only one issue: it is formatted with an emoji at the start. I wanted to use this on [my /now page](https://george.probably.blog/now), but emoji are built into lists automatically via omg.lol. This meant I was getting double-emoji, even if I used a zero-width joiner.

I raised this to Robb super casually on a Friday, and though he didn't owe me any solution (never mind a fast one), he fixed it at 8PM. 

### Lara Croft (and pens)

I have a bunch of friendship circles that (in my head) are very distinct, and it's always very funny seeing them cross over. In this case, I happen to know the person who literally wrote the book about [Tomb Raider](https://www.pen-and-sword.co.uk/The-Making-of-Tomb-Raider-Hardback/p/20165), and I saw a post from Robb talking about his hunt for [Lara Croft pens](https://rknight.me/blog/i-bought-the-tomb-raider-pen/).

This crossover was too incredible to pass up, and one day I sent Robb a cryptic message simply saying that I wanted to talk to him about something. He immediately video-called me, and we talked about a special edition of the pen. I made it my mission to find one for sale, and I did!

If you happen to have â‚¬350 burning a hole in your pocket, [please feel free to buy this for Robb.](https://www.leboncoin.fr/ad/collection/2639398321)

### Baby Bribes
If you've seen me talk about [Raisin](/reason/40), you'll know how much energy I get from spending time with children. Their excitement and wonder at everything in the world is infectious, and doing uncle duty is an absolute joy for me.

I don't get to see Raisin anywhere near as often as I'd like, and Robb is always more than happy to share photos of the Baby Knights as they grow up! I can't believe just how quickly they are both growing, and it doesn't feel physically possible, but I am fortunate to get an insight into their lives.

Robb is the kind of friend who encourages you to follow your passions, however quirky and weird they may be, and is always willing to do whatever he can to help them happen.

Robb, if you're reading this (I assume you are, since I have sent this to you to approve before I hit publish), thank you for being so unashamedly you all of the time. I am lucky to have you in my life, and I smile without fail every time I see a notification with your name on it. Next time we're in the same place, the first pint is on me.
