## Reason #7: The Desire to Keep Going (and being forgetful)
We're a week into this experiment, and honestly, I think I have been enjoying it. I've tried journalling previously but would quickly forget after only a few days.

That being said, I almost forgot today too... I started writing this post and then got sidetracked watching some Twitch streams and playing Faster Than Light. 

I said back in day one that sometimes the reason is something tiny like having a Tropical Twist-flavoured Fanta and thinking: "you know what? I could do that again sometime." but sometimes it's even smaller than that. It's the thought that I have started writing these posts daily, and I want to do it again tomorrow because I challenged myself to hit 30 so I'm sure as hell going to do it.

### Today was a 6/10
