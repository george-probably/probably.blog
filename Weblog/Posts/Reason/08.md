## Reason #8: momo
I love finding quirky artists, and the other week I was fortunate enough to discover [momo](https://ko-fi.com/heyheymomo). Momo makes some of the most adorable icons I have ever seen in my life. How adorable? Here's an example:

<div class="img-container-wide"> <img style="background: #9bdcfb;max-width: 100%;height: 100%;object-fit: contain;position: absolute;top: 50%;left: 50%;transform: translate(-50%, -50%);;" alt="A ghost with a knife" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/george-probably/chachanidze.com/main/Images/momo/ghostknife.png"></div>
<p><div class="caption">Prompt: "The thing that scares you most, but make it adorable."</div></p>

You may notice that my prompt wasn't exactly what you'd describe as... conventional. There's good reason for it. As someone who has been on both sides of this: a point I always try to make is that you're going to this artist/freelancer/whatever because you enjoy what they make, so you have to trust them to make something good.

My prompt was vague because I knew momo would make something incredible, and I wanted to give him the space to do that. Having had conversations with momo since - it seems he agrees and relishes the opportunity to try fun and crazy stuff. Whenever he is taking comissions, and I can think of a slightly wacky-crazy prompt, I'll make sure to send it his way.

<div class="img-container-wide"> <img style="background: #9bdcfb;max-width: 100%;height: 100%;object-fit: contain;position: absolute;top: 50%;left: 50%;transform: translate(-50%, -50%);;" alt="A dog with a large cup of coffee" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/george-probably/chachanidze.com/main/Images/momo/coffeedog.png"></div>
<p><div class="caption">Prompt: "What gets you out of bed in the morning?"</div></p>

Whether it be a ghost with a knife, or a dog with a large cup of coffee, there is no denying that momo's work is incredibly charming. Do yourself a favour, and check out his [ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/heyheymomo). 

Looking at both of the pieces of art brings that little bit of joy to my life every time I see them.
