## Reason #14: Vampire Survivors

I recently got into the game [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/). It's a roguelike shoot 'em up that I first discovered during The Game Awards. The mobile game is completely free on Android and iOS, so I had to give the game a go.

The simplicity is addictive, and once you level up enough the game almost starts playing itself in a super satisfying way. The best part? Even though it's free, all of the advertising in the game is completely optional! Die and want a cheeky revive? You can choose to watch and ad. Have a great run and want to double your gold? You can watch an ad. But at no point are you force to watch one.

You can check it out on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.poncle.vampiresurvivors) or the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vampire-survivors/id6444525702) if that sounds interesting to you!
