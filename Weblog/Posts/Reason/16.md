## Reason #16: Naps
Guys, I'll be honest... I messed up. I got home after a long day on set, had some dinner, and just passed out in bed.

The issue is: it's now 2am, and I have already slept for 5 hours. I'm typing this out on my phone because I know if I go to my PC I'll get distracted by something and end up pulling an all-nighter.

When they're not absolutely obliterating my sleep schedule though, naps are incredible. As someone who has a weird relationship with caffeine (it doesn't actually give me more energy, it just keeps me at my current energy levels for longer) it feels like magic that I can take an hour or two napping, and then come back with tonnes of energy!

I guess the moral of this story is nap in moderation, and don't forget to write out your reason before falling asleep!
