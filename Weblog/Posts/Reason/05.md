## Reason #5: stay staying :)
A large number of interactions I have with people occur over the internet. This was the case pre-COVID, as someone who moved around a lot as a child, I got used to having friends separate from my physical location.

In fact; at the start of COVID we'd often joke that with the world shutting down we had more time than ever to hang out on Discord.

In quiet moments, I remember this lyric: *"There may not be meaning, so find one and seize it."* I appreciate the sentiment, similar to *"There's no perfect moment, so pick a moment and make it perfect."* It's a reminder that things not being 100% are fine. Things very rarely are, and that's okay.

It's so easy for me to get in my head about everything in life, and it's often the smallest interactions with friends that put things into perspective for me. An example of this is when a friend messaged me with a simple: *"stay staying :)"*. They'll probably never know how much it helped, but I know I'll be forever grateful.
