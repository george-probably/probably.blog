## Reason #38: A Movie and Some Drinks

I've been making a point of going out more with friends, watching a film and grabbing some drinks afterwards.

After a low-key weekend where I watched the Formula 1 and did little else, I went to watch Evil Dead Rise with some friends.

This isn't going to be a movie review blog, but I will say the film was absolutely hilarious. There were multiple points in this 18-rated gore-filled horror film that the whole theater would burst out laughing.

As for the evening itself: It's always nice spending time with friends, and grabbing a few pints afterwards was really lovely.

### Today was a 8.5/10
