## Reason #32: Filming Days
Something about spending time on set is invigorating. I'm helping some friends with their short film, and though I was there from 8am-7pm, the 11 hours basically flew by.

When you're working with a good crew, long shoot days not only feel a lot shorter, but they feel a lot more productive too.

Unfortunately, my body doesn't work on how busy a day "feels", so after getting home I had dinner and immediately went to bed. Partially because I needed to catch up on sleep anyway, but also because of the long day.

With the body rested, and the desire to make a good film, I'm ready to head back on set and fight whatever fires end up appearing.

### Today was a 9/10
