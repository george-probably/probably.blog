## Reason #20: The Next Generation
No, not the show. I spent the evening at a social event for students considering doing a semester abroad, and their enthusiasm was infectious.

Everyone is so excited about their forthcoming journeys, visiting countries all over the world from Australia to the United States of America. I even met a couple of students planning to go to Volda just like I did 18 months ago!

Though the events run the risk of draining my social battery, they are an incredible boost in moderation, and working with the team is also incredibly fun.

I hope all of the students have as incredible of a semester abroad as I did, I'm sure that none of them will want to come back to Bath at the end of their time.
### Today was an 8/10
