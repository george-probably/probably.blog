## Reason #18: Music
If someone ever decides to make a movie about my life, feel free to hit me up and I'll have a soundtrack ready to go.

Whether it's musicians people expect me to like, like [Bastille](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0q_PBWOkFe3SKllFXf3eWw), [Imagine Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT9zcQNlyht7fRlcjmflRSA), and [halfÂ·alive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0q_PBWOkFe3SKllFXf3eWw), or those that make everyone give me a look of "Really? You listen to that?" with [Stormzy](https://www.youtube.com/@stormzy), [Dave](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5-cg5RahETrjGu-r8zjYCQ), and [Ghetts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZYVfumQrMOSAL_ERPxlkZg), there is no denying that I tend to fall down an artist rabbit hole and just binge albums on repeat. (links all go to the artist's YouTube Channel)

I have music playing in the background almost all of the time, whether I am playing some Rocket League, editing videos, or typing this reason right now! ([current song](https://song.link/gb/i/1513568030))

Tomorrow is a new week, and it's looking like it might be a busy one. Whenever I'm travelling, music is how I get into the right mindset before I arrive at a location. Heading somewhere I'm about to set the whole place on fire (metaphorically)? [This is the song](https://song.link/y/X4LfdjOrBwk). Thinking about those I love? [Something like this](https://song.link/gb/i/1488856672). Feeling like absolute crapola? [There's a song for that too](https://song.link/i/1272834375)!

No matter the situation, music has a way of intensifying those emotions. It's why when I'm listening to music and hear something particularly impactful I'll post the lyrics and a link to the song to my [Statuslog](https://georgeprobably.status.lol/) - so make sure to take a look if you want to see what's on my mind! Disclaimer: I listen to lots of sad music.
