## Reason #10: Surprise Family Visits

Last night I got a phone call from my dad. He said that he was planning on buying some car parts near me, and that we should grab lunch together. Today, we did exactly that. He drove up from London with my cousin, and we had a super lovely lunch where the three of us went to a pub and just hung out for a couple of hours. The weather in Bath was gorgeous, so we went for a walk through the town, and I managed to rack up over 8000 steps!

I love these little impromptu meetings. I have them with a friend once every few months as he finds himself in the area at short notice. Seeing people unexpectedly is always an energy boost, especially when we're just chilling and grabbing a bite to eat, or going for a walk in the sun.

I'm not much of a party guy, so having that one-on-one time with those I care about is essential to me.

Elsewhere, in the sport: Ireland won a grand slam in the Six Nations. Very well deserved, but also means that Georgia would have theoretically finished 5th if it was the seven nations *\*cough*\* *\*cough*\*. CharityFC are back at it again, conceding late to drop two points against Everton. Finally - The score seems to be 1-1 in the fight between Max Verstappen and Red Bull Reliability, as a driveshaft issue meant he has qualified 15th, and as such, we'll have to wait like 8 whole laps for him to get out into 1st.

### Today was an 8/10
