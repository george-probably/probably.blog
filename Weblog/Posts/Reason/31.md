## Reason #31: Friendly Visits
Today was a great day. Last night, my friend Kieran came down to visit me in Bath, we went for a walk and grabbed a few drinks. After 3 pints, and 2 double gin and tonics, we decided to call it a night.

It was nice, but nothing comes close to getting to spend quality time. Also, hangovers are becoming harder and harder, is this what getting old feels like? 

Today we went for a wander through Bath, getting breakfast, and enjoying the lovely weather. There are few things I genuinely enjoy more than spending time with those I love, and spending that time in person is always extra lovely.

### Today was a 8/10
